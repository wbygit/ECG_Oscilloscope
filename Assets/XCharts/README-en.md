## FAQ

1. Is `XCharts` free to use?  
A: `XCharts` uses the `MIT` licence and is free to use. You can also subscribe to `VIP` to enjoy more value-added services.

2. Does `XCharts` support code to dynamically add and modify data? Does it support getting data from `Excel` or a database?  
A: Support code to dynamically add and modify data, but data needs to be parsed or retrieved by itself, and then added to `XCharts` by calling the public interface of `XCharts`.

3. Does this plugin work on other platforms (e.g. Winform or WPF) besides Unity?  
A: It is currently only supported on Unity. Theoretically any version of Unity that supports `UGUI` can run `XCharts`.
